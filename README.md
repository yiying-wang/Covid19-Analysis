# The-COVID-19-Challenge: A Tale of Two-State

California and New York, two of the most well-known states in the U.S., have many similarities from geographic to demographic, from economic to political. This time, both of them are at the forefront of the fight against the epidemic, and we believe that their efforts are comparable.

Both states have a large population. California, with 40 million people, is ranked first and New York, with 20 million people, is ranked fourth. Both states have economic prosperity. California's GDP ranking first in the U.S., accounting for about 15% of the total, and New York State's GDP ranking third in the U.S., accounting for about 8% of the total. Furthermore, they are both democratic states with the highest concentration of millionaires.

California could have been a catastrophe. It has some of the country’s first coronavirus cases and its extensive ties to China, with 150,000 people flew in from there in January. New York, too, has potential pitfalls, with New York City, probably the most mobile and densely populated city in the world.

Looking back from mid-April, the two states differed significantly. New York has become the center of the epidemic, with confirmed cases and deaths exponentially increasing. California seems to be beating the odds, ranked 30th in the nation in coronavirus deaths per capita.

What contributes to such a significant discrepancy? The response time and the intensity of the policy could be a major factor. At the beginning of March, when the two states had similar numbers of confirmed cases, Silicon Valley started to ask all of the employees to work from home, closely followed by the city of San Francisco and six Bay Area counties declared Shelter-in-place. In contrast, New York declared similar policies about 3-5 days later, with the number of confirmed cases was about 16 times compared to California. Indicated by the restaurant and transportation data, Californians were alerted and started practicing social distancing. Additionally, the practice was already commonplace in the state, spurred by the tech industry. However, New Yorkers were still hanging out and commuting, living a metropolitan life. Moreover, governors of the two states also play critical roles. One of the channels between society and governor is social media. After Natural Language Processing on governors’ twitter data since February, we found the New York State governor Andrew Cuomo is more influential than Gavin Newsom, the California governor. They both leverage the power of the social media during this epidemic and tweeted with ‘#covid19’, ‘#stayathome’, and ‘#stayhomesavelives’ to draw people’s attention of the disease as well as the importance of social distance. Cuomo gave more human care to New York state people with positive words. On the other hand, Newsom is more serious and objective about the situation. This maybe make California people more serious about the situation and strictly enforce the social distancing.

California’s timely response has brought it time and flattened the curve. In contrast, there were intense burden in perspectives of hospitalization and testing in New York. It is indicated that there might be a shortage in beds and ICUs for New York, while California donated 500 ventilators to the state. Additionally, though New York has fired in full force for testing, the positive rate remained at a relatively high level. As a result, New York had 8.18 times confirmed cases and 14.06 times deaths. 

Experience with wildfires and earthquakes. The California state government has built up extensive disaster-response machinery, and people are accustomed to obeying official orders in a crisis. California’s timely response has been proved to be the key to win the epidemic, while the humane care embodied in New York in the midst of the disaster has provided solid support for its people. We hope that all government could learn from this case and better serves its people.
